# ndn-python-svs: State Vector Sync NDN Python library

This python library implements the State Vector Sync (SVS) protocol to synchronise states between multiple clients over NDN for distributed realtime applications that is originally implemented and designed in c++ [here](https://github.com/named-data/ndn-svs).

**This is NOT an official implementation and consider 'experimental'**.

ndn-python-svs uses the [python-ndn](https://github.com/named-data/python-ndn) library for it's implementation.
