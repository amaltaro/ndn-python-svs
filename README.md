# ndn-python-svs: State Vector Sync python library for distributed realtime applications for NDN

This python library implements the State Vector Sync (SVS) protocol to synchronise state between multiple clients over NDN that is originally implemented and designed in c++ [here](https://github.com/named-data/ndn-svs).


ndn-python-svs uses the [python-ndn](https://github.com/named-data/python-ndn) library.
