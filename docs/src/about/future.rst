Future Work
===========

Implementation Advancements
---------------------------

There are many improvements to ndn-python-svs that need to be made.
    * Calculate the exact lengths for all balance packets
    * Robustly test Security Measures
    * Better documentation

Performance Testing
-------------------

The NDN StateVectorSync Protocol in python is constantly improving it's settings to meet performance.
Finding the optimal delay or duration between sync interests comes from constant real-world testing of ndn-python-svs.
